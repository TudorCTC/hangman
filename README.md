# Hangman

This is a simple implementation of the game Hangman. I used this project as an opportunity to learn more about C#. 

The game can be run by opening a terminal and running:
```
./Hangman.exe
```
# Improvements

The game needs some more polish:

1. More robust input sanitization
2. More graceful/fair error handling (e.g., if the user enters a letter that they have already guesses, the game should warn them instead of counting it as a missed guess)
3. A proper GUI

I may come back to this project in the future to address these issues.
